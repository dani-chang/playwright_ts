## Journal
This file will log commits where I found unexpected issues; how I fixed them; introduction to new concepts and so on. 

#### 4/20/2025 - INTRO TO NEW CONCEPTS
My introduction to the concepts of `Types` and `Fixtures` and how to implement them.
Seems comprehensible when thinking of simple examples, but a bit harder to wrap my head around when trying to integrate them with Playwright.

#### 4/25/2025 - FIRST EXP USING FIXTURES
Pretty cool.
I didn't have to duplicate code by instantiating whatever page class I needed to use in every single test().
Also using `getByRole('listitem').filter({hasText: 'Home'})` to find text from a <li> is pretty handy.

Decided to use a separate .md for journals instead of a README.
