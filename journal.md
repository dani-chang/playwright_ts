## Journal
This file will log commits where I found unexpected issues; how I fixed them; introduction to new concepts and so on. <br>

#### 4/20/2025 - INTRO TO NEW CONCEPTS
My introduction to the concepts of `Types` and `Fixtures` and how to implement them. <br>
Seems comprehensible when thinking of simple examples, but a bit harder to wrap my head around when trying to integrate them with Playwright. <br>

#### 4/25/2025 - FIRST EXP USING FIXTURES
Pretty cool. <br>
I didn't have to duplicate code by instantiating whatever page class I needed to use in every single test(). <br>
Also using `getByRole('listitem').filter({hasText: 'Home'})` to find text from a `<li>` is pretty handy. <br>

Decided to use a separate .md for journals instead of a README.
