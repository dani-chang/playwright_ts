## Journal
I'm using this repo/README more as a journal to log commits where I found issues, was introduced to new concepts and so on. 

#### Commit 40dc0ee - 4/20/2025 - INTRO TO NEW CONCEPTS
My introduction to the concepts of `Types` and `Fixtures` and how to implement them. <br>
Seems comprehensible when thinking of simple examples, but a bit harder to wrap my head around when trying to integrate them with Playwright.
